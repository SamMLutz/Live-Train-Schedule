# train-project-homework
In this project we have a train schedule we can view in live time. Using the input fields, new trains can be added to the schedule. Upon refresh the train schedules will update live including a next arrival time as well as a minutes until arrival section. In this project we use firebase to store data and persist that data on the page. We used moment.js for all the timing calculations. Using jquery we create "on click" event listeners to add our information to the page and the firebase database. To calculate the arrival time and the minutes until arrival sections we used moment.js in conjuction with the firebase "on child added" listener to dynamically add our train information to the page.
